# Responding to a Security Incident Lab

## Objective

This project focused on analyzing a DDoS attack on a multimedia company’s internal network and developing a comprehensive security strategy based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). Key tasks included identifying vulnerabilities, such as unconfigured firewalls, and implementing measures like rate-limiting ICMP traffic, source IP verification, and enhanced network monitoring to prevent future incidents and improve the organization’s overall security posture.



### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to create a structured security strategy.
- Ability to identify network vulnerabilities through audits of firewalls, traffic patterns, and access controls.
- Knowledge of mitigating DDoS attacks by implementing rate-limiting, source IP verification, and filtering mechanisms.
- Strengthened skills in using network monitoring tools to detect abnormal traffic and improve incident detection efficiency.
- Experience in developing a comprehensive incident response and recovery plan for affected network services.
- Analytical problem-solving skills to assess and address security incidents effectively.



### Tools Used

- Firewall configuration tools for rate-limiting ICMP traffic and source IP verification.
- Network monitoring software to identify and analyze abnormal traffic patterns.
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to filter suspicious ICMP traffic.
- Documentation platforms for recording security incidents and recovery plans.
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) as a guideline for developing and implementing the security strategy.
